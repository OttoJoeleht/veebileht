    <h1>AUDI</h1>
    <br>
<p>Audi as we now know it launched their first car in 1910 and was the </p>
    <p>Audi Type A Sport-Phaeton. Itâ€™s successor, the Type B was also launched</p>
        <p>that year. Both were successes, particularly in sporting events. Horch had led his </p>
            <p>team to three straight victories in the Austrian Alpine Run.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was in 1920 that Horch left Audi to take up a high position in the ministry</p>
        <p>of transport but in his short time at the manufacturer, he had made the brand </p>
            <p>internationally known. Shortly after he left, Audi became the first German car brand </p>
                <p>to produce a car that was left-hand drive, the Audi Type K. This became dominant in the</p>
                    <p>1920s due to the fact it gave drivers a better view of oncoming traffic. This, in turn, </p>
                        <p>made it easier and safer to overtake.</p>
